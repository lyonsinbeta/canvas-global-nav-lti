# canvas-global-nav-lti

A simple (unsupported and unofficial!) way to add items to the global nav in Canvas. Seriously, it says right in the [External Tools API documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/external_tools.html)
> NOTE: Placements not documented here should be considered beta features and are not officially supported.

# How To Use This

1. Don't use this, it's just a proof of concept
2. Follow [these instructions to configure an LTI as an admin](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-3031)
3. Use the xml in this repo, configured as appropriate
4. _Don't actually use this_
